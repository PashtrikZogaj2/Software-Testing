# README - Software Testing Project

## Project Overview
This project involves comprehensive software testing of the **Elsig** website using **Playwright** for automation, along with manual testing of the **Udemy** website. Additionally, unit testing was conducted on an open-source JavaScript function. Mobile application testing was also performed on Android and iOS platforms to ensure functionality across different environments.

## Tools Used
- **Playwright** for automated web testing
- **Manual testing** for evaluating usability and consistency
- **Unit Testing** for validating JavaScript functionality
- **Android Studio & iOS Simulator** for mobile application testing

## Testing Approach

### Web Application Testing (Elsig)
The testing process for **Elsig** covered both functional and non-functional aspects to ensure a reliable and secure application. Using **Playwright**, key user scenarios were automated to improve efficiency and detect issues quickly.

#### **Functional Testing**
- The login and registration processes were tested with valid and invalid credentials to check authentication.
- Buttons, links, and forms were automated to confirm proper functionality and navigation.
- Page transitions and menu interactions were validated for smooth user experience.
- API requests were intercepted to ensure correct data exchange and system responses.

#### **Non-Functional Testing**
- **Performance:** Simulated high user loads to assess system response times.
- **Security:** Tested unauthorized access attempts and SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- **Loading Speed:** Measured page load times and optimized performance where necessary.

#### **Usability and Compatibility Testing**
- Evaluated UI intuitiveness and consistency in error messages and interactions.
- Ensured compatibility across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
- Verified responsive design across different screen sizes.

All **Elsig** test cases were executed using **Visual Studio Code** with Playwright for streamlined automation and debugging.

### Manual Testing (Udemy)
For the **Udemy** website, manual testing was performed to evaluate user experience and interface reliability.

#### **Functional Testing**
- Tested login and course enrollment by manually navigating through user flows.
- Verified button interactions, forms, and search functionality.

#### **Usability and Compatibility Testing**
- Reviewed design consistency and ease of use.
- Checked browser responsiveness and stability.

Additionally, **unit tests** were created for an open-source JavaScript function to validate accuracy across various test cases.

### Mobile Application Testing
Mobile testing focused on installation, login, push notifications, device compatibility, and performance under different conditions. Key aspects such as offline functionality, responsiveness, and integration with device features like GPS and camera were thoroughly examined.

## Conclusion
This project successfully validated the stability, usability, and security of the **Elsig** website through Playwright automation, while manual testing ensured real-world applicability for the **Udemy** platform. The inclusion of unit tests and mobile application evaluations further strengthened the overall quality assessment, providing a comprehensive approach to software testing.
